          <h4>RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN</h4>
          <p>
            Responsive web design is a device-independent UI design that aims to
            develop & deliver an optimized website experience on devices with
            different width & resolutions: Desktop, Smartphones etc. It is a
            technology using which web designers code the style of the website
            in a manner that its layout adjust itself to more comfortably to the
            width of the browser in which it is being viewed.
